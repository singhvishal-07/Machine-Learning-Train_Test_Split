# Machine-Learning-Train_Test_Split
The 'train_test_split' in python, data we use is usually split into training data and test data. The training set contains a known output and the model learns on this data in order to be generalized to other data later on. We have the test dataset (or subset) in order to test our modelâ€™s prediction on this subset.
